# Fake News Detection

This project serves as an introductory machine learning project for myself as I learn how to use many of these tools. Here, I've trained a model on numerous articles to be able to predict whether a given article is that of fake news or not.

### How to run yourself

1. git clone the repository
2. cmd jupyter lab in the appropriate directory
